# Semantic Text to Image Storyboard Synthesis
***

### Project Overview
In this transformative era of advertising and recognizing the potential for technology to
streamline and enhance the ad creation process, Adludio is embarking on an
ambitious initiative to automate the end-to-end process of advertising production.
Adludio is a well renowned company in the business of advertisement creation for
different customers across the globe.
One aspect involves automation of this process so that the generation of potential
creative concepts based on the client's brief.
This transformation process aims to visually depict the narrative flow and user
interaction within advertisements, making the conceptualization of digital campaigns
both more intuitive and impactful.
Our task for this week, as part of this transformative process, is to architect and
develop a cutting-edge machine learning solution that automates the conversion of
textual advertisement concepts, assets descriptions into visually compelling
storyboards.

### Project Guide
Bring the concept to life, we will be using the perks of machine learning and diffusion
models broadly.
As a general scheme for the workflow, we have divided the project into three tasks for
ease of approach.
1) Image Generation and EDA analysis on the given Assets

- This task involves the generation of images using a model by adding the
concepts or ideas given as data. These concepts need some adjustment before
they are handed out to the LLMs for image generation.
- As for the EDA, that is a crucial step to help us identify the positions and
dimensions of images we find on a certain image on a Storyboard(either the
landing page or the Ending page). We can use the image search on image to
check and examine the segmented images.
Progress in Screenshots- Generated Images from the Concept and
Framework
2) Image Composition
3) Storyboard Creation
All tasks have different underlists and we will approach all as we dive deeper into the project. But for now we have completed the image generation part and seen some potential results for a good Storyboard creation.
